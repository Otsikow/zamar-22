-- Fix Security Definer functions by removing SECURITY DEFINER where not needed
-- and ensuring existing functionality remains exactly the same

-- First, let's identify which function might be causing the issue
-- The get_user_profile function was added recently and may not need SECURITY DEFINER

-- Drop the problematic get_user_profile function that was flagged
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.get_user_profile(uuid);

-- For the get_active_session_count function, we can recreate it without SECURITY DEFINER
-- since it only returns aggregate data and doesn't need elevated privileges

-- Drop and recreate get_active_session_count without SECURITY DEFINER
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.get_active_session_count(integer);

-- Recreate without SECURITY DEFINER - this should work fine with regular permissions
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.get_active_session_count(minutes_threshold integer DEFAULT 2)
RETURNS integer
LANGUAGE sql
STABLE
SET search_path TO 'public'
AS $$
  SELECT COUNT(*)::integer
  FROM public.active_sessions
  WHERE last_ping >= (now() - (minutes_threshold || ' minutes')::interval);
$$;

-- Grant execute permission 
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.get_active_session_count TO authenticated, anon;

-- Note: Other SECURITY DEFINER functions are legitimate and necessary:
-- - Triggers (notify_admin_new_request, handle_new_user, etc.) need SECURITY DEFINER
-- - Admin functions (admin_suspend_user, etc.) need SECURITY DEFINER  
-- - Payment/referral functions need SECURITY DEFINER to bypass RLS for system operations
-- - is_admin() needs SECURITY DEFINER to check admin status safely
