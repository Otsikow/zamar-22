-- Final attempt to resolve security definer issues by removing it from functions that don't strictly need it
-- Most functions here legitimately need SECURITY DEFINER, but we can try to minimize usage

-- Functions that might not need SECURITY DEFINER:
-- 1. get_user_role - can work with regular permissions since it just checks admin_users table
-- 2. Some stats functions might work without it

-- Recreate get_user_role without SECURITY DEFINER (but this might break admin functionality)
-- We'll keep it minimal and only modify what's truly safe to change

-- Drop and recreate get_active_session_count to ensure it's not flagged
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.get_active_session_count(integer);

-- Create with proper security but no SECURITY DEFINER
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.get_active_session_count(minutes_threshold integer DEFAULT 2)
RETURNS integer
LANGUAGE sql
STABLE
SET search_path TO 'public'
AS $$
  SELECT COUNT(*)::integer
  FROM public.active_sessions
  WHERE last_ping >= (now() - (minutes_threshold || ' minutes')::interval);
$$;

-- Grant execute permission 
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.get_active_session_count TO authenticated, anon;

-- Note: We're keeping most SECURITY DEFINER functions because they are legitimately needed:
-- - Admin functions MUST use SECURITY DEFINER to bypass RLS
-- - Trigger functions MUST use SECURITY DEFINER to work properly
-- - Payment/referral functions MUST use SECURITY DEFINER to access restricted data
-- - is_admin() MUST use SECURITY DEFINER to check admin status safely

-- The linter may be flagging these as a general security concern, but they are necessary
-- for the application's business logic to function correctly
