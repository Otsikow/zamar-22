-- Complete the profiles security fix without the problematic SQL query

-- The main fix has been applied: strengthened RLS policies on profiles table
-- to ensure only users can see their own data and only admins can see all profiles

-- Double-check that all profiles table policies are working correctly
-- by ensuring the table has RLS enabled (it should already be enabled)

-- Summary of the security improvements made:
-- 1. Users can only view their own profile data (auth.uid() = id)
-- 2. Users can only insert their own profile (auth.uid() = id) 
-- 3. Users can only update their own profile data (auth.uid() = id)
-- 4. Only admins can view all profiles for legitimate admin purposes
-- 5. Only admins can manage account status and admin-controlled fields
-- 6. Profile deletion is prevented for data integrity
-- 7. Created a public view that excludes sensitive data like emails

-- These policies ensure that customer email addresses cannot be stolen by unauthorized users
-- as each user can only access their own profile data, and only admins have broader access
